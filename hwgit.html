      <h2>What is GIT? Why do we need source code Version Control System?</h2>
      <p>Git is an Open Source Distributed Version Control System. There are three layers for Git. First, Control System. This basically means that Git is a content tracker. So Git can be used to store content. It is mostly used to store code due to the other features it provides. Second, Version Control System. The code which is stored in Git keeps changing as more code is added. Also, many developers can add code in parallel. So Version Control System helps in handling this by maintaining a history of what changes have happened. Also, Git provides features like branches and merges, which I will be covering later. Third, Distributed Version Control System. Git has a remote repository which is stored in a server and a local repository which is stored in the computer of each developer. This means that the code is not just stored in a central server, but the full copy of the code is present in all the developers' computers. Git is a Distributed Version Control System since the code is present in every developer's computer. I will explain the concept of remote and local repositories later in this article. There are three reasons why we need the Version Control System. Firstly, real life projects generally have multiple developers working in parallel. So a version control system like Git is needed to ensure there are no code conflicts between the developers. Additionally, the requirements in such projects change often. So a version control system allows developers to revert and go back to an older version of the code. Finally, sometimes several projects which are being run in parallel involve the same codebase. In such a case, the concept of branching in Git is very important.

      <h2>Describe following terms: 1) local repo 2) remote repo 3) how to use GIT in Team Project - multiple developers work on the same project at the same time</h2>
      <br>The local repo is on our computer and has all the files and their commit history, enabling full diffs, history review, and committing when offline.  This is one of the key features of a "distributed" version control system (DVCS), locally having the full repository history. Git refers to the centralized server as a "remote repository". The remote repo is usually not on our machine and is the one shared by the team. The team "pushes" commits to it when ready to share with the team. While one of our remote repos could be another team member's local repo, in a corporate environment at least one (or the only) is typically a Git repo on a server anointed as the central/official repo.
